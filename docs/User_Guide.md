If you have your Clubhouse API token ready, you can enter it into the text box where it says “Clubhouse API key” and press enter.

If nothing happens after clicking the “Enter” button, double-check to make sure that you have entered your API token correctly into the specified text field. If you are sure that you have entered your API token correctly and you are still unable to login, then there is a chance that your Clubhouse API token is invalid and you will need to create a new API token using the steps mentioned previously.

**Congratulations! You are now ready to take on your first Boss with the rest of your team! Good luck in your journey and welcome to Clubhouse Dungeons!**
